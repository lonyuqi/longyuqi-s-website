    <h2>This is the story of SpongeBob Squarepants and the fish hook...</h2>

    <p>Today, SpongeBob was mopping the floor at the Krabby Patty restaurant and had just wiped the gum from under Table Nine when Mr. Krabs rushed in yelling, "Not again, not again! This time I saw it with my own eyes!" But the guests don't want to hear about Mr. Krabs' supposed adventures. Mr. Krabs comes to Squidward again, but Squidward doesn't care about his boss, even if he's looking at the garbage in the trash can. Mr. Krabs throws down, "Good! Don't say I didn't warn you! ' And he left.
      Sure enough, SpongeBob had the biggest laugh, asking Mr. Krabs what kind of hook?</p>
    <p>Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob come up to the skylight of the restaurant and answer, "They will tempt you with delicious treats. You think you have found food heaven, but they will actually pull you up until they pull you out of the water, then cook and eat you! (but who eats sponges?) or make them gifts and put them in the gift shop!"
      Spongebob hides in the crate. Mr. Krabs confidently says, "As long as you listen to Mr. Krabs, you'll be fine. Get back to the kitchen.
      Spongebob sneaks back into the kitchen hidden in the wooden box, gets his little shovel, and is making Krabby Patty.</p>
    <p>In a few words, Patrick drags SpongeBob to the circus. They want to see the show!So they went to the circus, but Patrick saw a fish hook with cheese on it! He did not hesitate to open his mouth, about to be brought to the surface of the pie big star jumped down, so began to play the game with the hook, SpongeBob Squarepants, but also and pie big star play very happy, and forget that they have to go back to do delicious Krabby Patty.
      Meanwhile, the diners at the Crab Bun restaurant were eating richly seared crab Patty, from Squidward. Angry, Mr. Krabs goes to the beach and rescues SpongeBob.</p>
    <p>But the next day, Patrick was around his house, still having fun with the hooks. Although SpongeBob declined the invitation to send Big Star, but still can not resist the way to work, sitting on the hook. But instead of escaping, he got caught on a hook in his underwear. A shamed SpongeBob has to shamelessly go to the Krabby Patty restaurant and ask Mr. Krabs for help. Mr. Krabs says that you can be saved by taking off your pants, but SpongeBob refuses to give up his last piece of dignity and finally gets his underwear hooked off by a fish hook, to the amusement of the Krabby Patty guests.</p>
    <p>Back at the Krabby Patty restaurant, we learn that the man who hooked SpongeBob is none other than Squidward trying to teach SpongeBob a lesson.</p>
