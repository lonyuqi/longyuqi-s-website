    <h2>This is the story of SpongeBob Squarepants and the fish hook...</h2>
    <h3>- This space is the Krabby Patty Restaurant</h3>

    <p>Today, SpongeBob was mopping the floor at the Krabby Patty restaurant and had just wiped the gum from under Table Nine when Mr. Krabs rushed in yelling, "Not again, not again! This time I saw it with my own eyes!" But the guests don't want to hear about Mr. Krabs' supposed adventures. Mr. Krabs comes to Squidward again, but Squidward doesn't care about his boss, even if he's looking at the garbage in the trash can. Mr. Krabs throws down, "Good! Don't say I didn't warn you! ' And he left.
      Sure enough, SpongeBob had the biggest laugh, asking Mr. Krabs what kind of hook?</p>
    <p>Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob come up to the <a href="2.html">restaurant</a> and answer:</p>
    
    <p>Back at the Krabby Patty restaurant, we learn that the man who hooked SpongeBob is none other than Squidward trying to teach SpongeBob a lesson.</p>
