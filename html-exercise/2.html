    <h3>- This space is the skylight of the Krabby Patty restaurant</h3>
 
    <p>Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob come up to the skylight of the restaurant and answer, "They will tempt you with delicious treats. You think you have found food heaven, but they will actually pull you up until they pull you out of the water, then cook and eat you! (but who eats sponges?) or make them gifts and put them in the gift shop!"
        Spongebob hides in the crate. Mr. Krabs confidently says, "As long as you listen to Mr. Krabs, you'll be fine. Get back to the kitchen.
        Spongebob sneaks back into the kitchen hidden in the wooden box, gets his little shovel, and is making Krabby Patty.In a few words, Patrick drags SpongeBob to the <a href="3.html">circus</a>. They want to see the show!</p>
