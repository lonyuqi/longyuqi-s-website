    <p>Mr. Krabs replies from the restaurant skylight, "They tempt you with delicious treats. You think you've found a gourmet paradise, but they actually pull you up until they pull you out of the water, and then they cook and eat you! (but who eats sponges?) or make them gifts and put them in the gift shop!"
        Spongebob hides in the crate. Mr. Krabs confidently says, "As long as you listen to Mr. Krabs, you'll be fine. Get back to the kitchen. So SpongeBob sneaks back into the <a href="kitchen/index.html">restaurant skylight...</a> hidden in the wooden crate, gets his little spatula, and starts making Krabby Patty.</p>
